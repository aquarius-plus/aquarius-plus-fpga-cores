MID$ Function and Statement
The MID$ function returns part of a string (a substring).

*MID$(stringexpression$,start%[,length%])*

    @ *stringexpression$*    The string from which the MID$ function returns
                           a substring. It can be any string expression.
    @ *start%*               The position of the first character in the
                           substring being returned.
    @ *length%*              The number of characters in the substring. If the
                           length is omitted, MID$ returns all characters to
                           the right of the start position.

Example:
    a$ = "Where is Paris?"
    PRINT MID$(a$, 10, 5)       'Output is:  Paris
