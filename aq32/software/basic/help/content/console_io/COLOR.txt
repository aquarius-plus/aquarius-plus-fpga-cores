                     a color attribute or 4-bit color value (screen mode 4

                     palette%    Attribute 1    Attribute 2    Attribute 3
                     ========    ===========    ===========    ============
                     0           Green          Red            Brown
                     1           Cyan           Magenta        Bright white

    @ The available color attributes and values depend on your graphics
      adapter and the screen mode set by the most recent SCREEN statement.
    @ If your system is equipped with an EGA, VGA, or MCGA adapter, use the
      PALETTE statement to change the color assignments of color attributes.

Example:
    'This example requires a color graphics adapter.
    SCREEN 7
    FOR i% = 0 TO 15
        COLOR i%
        PRINT i%
    NEXT i%
