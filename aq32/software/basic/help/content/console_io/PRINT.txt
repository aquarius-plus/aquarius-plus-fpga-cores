PRINT writes data to the screen or to a file.
LPRINT prints data on the printer LPT1.

*PRINT [#filenumber%,] [expressionlist] [{; | ,}]*
*LPRINT [expressionlist] [{; | ,}]*

    @ *filenumber%*       The number of an open file. If you don't specify a
                        file number, PRINT writes to the screen.
    @ *expressionlist*    A list of one or more numeric or string expressions
                        to print.
    @ *{; | ,}*           Determines where the next output begins:
                          ; means print immediately after the last value.
                          , means print at the start of the next print zone.
                            Print zones are 14 characters wide.

Example:
    OPEN "TEST.DAT" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
    PRINT #1, USING "##.###  "; 12.12345
    CLOSE
    OPEN "TEST.DAT" FOR INPUT AS #1
    INPUT #1, a$
    PRINT a$
    LPRINT "This is a line"; 1
    LPRINT "This is a line",
    LPRINT 2
