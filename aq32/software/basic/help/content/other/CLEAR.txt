Closes all files, releases file buffers, clears all common variables, sets
numeric variables and arrays to zero, sets string variables to null, and
initializes the stack. Optionally, CLEAR also changes the size of the stack.

*CLEAR [,,stack&]*

    @ *stack&*    Sets the size (in bytes) of stack space for your program.

Example:
    CLEAR ,,2000
