Branches to and returns from a subroutine.

*GOSUB line1*
*.*
*.*
*.*
*RETURN [line2]*

    @ *line1*    The label or line number of the first line of the subroutine.
    @ *line2*    The label or line number where the subroutine returns.

    @ If you don't supply a label or line number for RETURN, the program
      continues execution at the statement following the GOSUB (for
      subroutine calls) or where an event occurred (for event handling).
    @ SUB and CALL statements provide a better alternative to GOSUB
      subroutines.

Example:
    FOR i% = 1 TO 20
        GOSUB Square
    NEXT
    END

    Square:
    PRINT i%, i% * i%
    RETURN
