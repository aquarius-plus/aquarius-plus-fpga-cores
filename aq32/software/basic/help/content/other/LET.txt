Assigns the value of an expression to a variable.

*[LET] variable=expression*

    @ *variable*      Any variable. Variable names can consist of up to 40
                    characters and must begin with a letter. Valid characters
                    are A-Z, 0-9, and period (.).
    @ *expression*    Any expression that provides a value to assign.

    @ Use of the optional LET keyword is not recommended. The
      variable=expression assignment statement performs the same action
      with or without LET.
