*DIM variable(subscripts)[,variable(subscripts)]...*

    @ *variable*      The name of an array or variable.
    @ *subscripts*    Dimensions of the array, expressed as follows:
    
                    *upper [,upper]...*

                    *upper*    The upper bound of the array's subscripts.
                             The lower bound always is zero.
