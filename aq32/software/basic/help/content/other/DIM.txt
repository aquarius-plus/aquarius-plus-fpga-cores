DIM declares an array or specifies a data type for a nonarray variable.
REDIM declares or resizes a dynamic array, erasing any previous values.

*DIM [SHARED] variable[(subscripts)] [AS type]*
*             [,variable[(subscripts)] [AS type]]...*
*REDIM [SHARED] variable(subscripts) [AS type]*
*               [,variable(subscripts) [AS type]]...*

    @ *SHARED*        Specifies that variables are shared with all SUB or
                    FUNCTION procedures in the module.
    @ *variable*      The name of an array or variable.
    @ *subscripts*    Dimensions of the array, expressed as follows:

                    [lower TO] upper [,[lower TO] upper]...

                    lower    The lower bound of the array's subscripts. The
                             default lower bound is zero.
                    upper    The upper bound.

    @ *AS type*       Declares the data type of the array or variable
                    (INTEGER, LONG, SINGLE, DOUBLE, STRING, or a
                    user-defined data type).

    @ DIM declares either static or dynamic arrays. Unless array storage has
      been determined by $STATIC, $DYNAMIC, or COMMON, arrays dimensioned
      with numbers are static and arrays dimensioned with variables are
      dynamic. REDIM always declares dynamic arrays.
    @ Static array storage is allocated when you start a program and
      remains fixed. Dynamic array storage is allocated while a program runs.

Example:
    ' $DYNAMIC
    DIM A(49, 49)
    REDIM A(19, 14)
