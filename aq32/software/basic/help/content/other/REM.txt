Allows explanatory remarks to be inserted in a program.

*REM remark*
*' remark*

    @ *remark*    Any text.

    @ Remarks are ignored when the program runs unless they contain
      metacommands.
    @ A remark can be inserted on a line after an executable statement if it
      is preceded by the single-quote (') form of REM or if REM is preceded
      by a colon (:).

Example:
    REM    This is a comment.
    '      This is also a comment.
    PRINT "Test1"       'This is a comment after a PRINT statement.
    PRINT "Test2" :  REM This is also a comment after a PRINT statement.
